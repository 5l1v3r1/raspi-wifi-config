# raspi-wifi-config

## Work in progress

- [x] Option to enable ssh
- [ ] Option to create a USB Ethernet device (should work, but might need more configuration)
- [x] Option to add WiFi networks to automatically connect to
- [ ] Option to host an AP (hotspot) on the Raspberry Pi (might work, but untested)

## How to use
Just download the script and open it with bash.  
You can either run it on your Raspberry Pi or you can mount your Raspberry Pi's SD card on a different computer (both partitions need to be mounted).
